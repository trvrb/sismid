# Pathogen diversity

### Introduction to pathogen diversity

* [Slides](slides.html)

### Pathogen comparison

* *Exercise: Assigning study groups and picking questions to address. Divide into groups of 4-6 people and choose a question from the list below.*
* [Lineup of pathogens and questions](../lineup/)

### Additional resources

* An expansive database of basic information on viruses: [ViralZone](http://viralzone.expasy.org/)
* Many of these pathogens have phylogenies available via [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/pathogens)
* Rates of adaptive evolution available for many viruses via [Atlas of Viral Adaptation](https://blab.github.io/atlas-of-viral-adaptation/)
